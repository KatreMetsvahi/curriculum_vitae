I am in search for a place in a collective where completing a sprint is a fundamental belief and code reviews are something to learn from. My wish is to work in a team where decisions are made together and overcoming difficulties is a joint effort as well. I know how to find solutions to my problems but can also tell when it is a good time to ask for help."
